# The PgBeam CLI.
#
# `version` and every `sha256` below are written by the release pipeline, not by
# hand: .github/workflows/release.yml (job `cli-homebrew`) reads the checksums off
# the binaries it has just built and published, rewrites this file through
# .github/scripts/commit-homebrew-formula.sh, and the mirror sync pushes it to
# sferarc/homebrew-pgbeam. An edit made here by hand is overwritten by the next
# release, and a checksum that does not match the release asset breaks
# `brew install` for everyone.
#
# The all-zero checksums are placeholders, and they are deliberately impossible
# rather than merely wrong: `brew install` refuses to install against them, which
# is what should happen before any release has run. Nothing about them looks like
# a real digest, so nobody can mistake one for a value that was checked.
